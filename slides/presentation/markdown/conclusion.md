## Conclusion

---

## The good

- 🏗 Cosmos SDK provides a good foundation to build an application-specific blockchain.

- 🔑 The protocol uses reliable cryptography and good economic incentives.

---

## The bad

- 📉 Validators are incentivized to secure the network, but zones compete for this security. There's no shared security.

- ❌ Validator voting system is flawed. Voters need to compromise. The current situation reflects this and puts the system at risk.
