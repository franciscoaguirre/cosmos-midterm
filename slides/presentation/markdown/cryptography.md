**Goal:** Evaluate the use of cryptography in this project; name at least two things you liked and two things you would want to improve.

- What are the main cryptographic primitives used in this blockchain project?

- Does this project use any exotic primitives? If so, which ones?

- How does this project use digital signatures for security?

- How does this project use hashing and hash-based data structures to ensure security?
